Artemis I, the first test flight of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft around the Moon, was set to launch shortly after I began full-time. Since I had previous experience with Artemis I off-nominal trajectory development, I was able to fast-track my certification as a Trajectory Analysis, Retargeting, and Optimization Officer (TARGO) in the Mission Evaluation Room (MER) in Mission Control Center (MCC).\nI supported multiple shifts throughout the course of the 26 day mission (despite a brief hiatus after getting COVID while working console). Each shift, I’d communicate over the loops with other flight controllers, assess off-nominal trajectory capabilities for that phase of the mission, and update the current reference trajectory from navigation states received from the spacecraft. Not to mention, I got to be one of the first to see some of the incredible images downlinked from Orion during its two lunar flybys and coast in a Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) beyond the Moon. Overall, the mission was a wild success!",

The nominal trajectory spends about a day in High Earth Orbit (HEO) before injecting into a lunar free return trajectory, giving a total mission duration of about nine days. Off-nominal trajectory analysis is also a key area of concern for the mission design team, as continuous abort coverage throughout the entire mission is required to get the crew safely home under off-nominal events.\nMy task was to develop abort trajectories across a range of conditions, including different launch days, launch times, phases of the mission, times of abort burns, number of abort burns, engines used for burns, returns durations, and more. The sheer quantity of different permutations of abort trajectories (10,000+) meant that automation and parallel processing were critical. Individual trajectories would be numerically optimized with Copernicus, a generalized trajectory optimization software. Each of these individual trajectories would be represented as a single node in a giant Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the entire scan. By developing the Python tools to automate the parallel processing of this scan DAG, I was able to quantify our abort capability throughout the mission, a crucial step in developing flight rules for how the vehicle would be flown real-time.",

The nominal trajectory is targeting a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), where Orion will coast before rendezvousing with the Human Landing System (HLS) vehicle to take the crew down to the lunar surface. Future Artemis missions (Artemis IV, Artemis V, etc.) will also follow similar mission profiles, targeting the NRHO as the baseline orbit.\nAbort trajectory analysis is equally as imperative as it was for Artemis II. The difficult problem is this: how does one adapt the framework used for Artemis II aborts development to work for a completely different mission with a wildly different trajectory? This was one of our lessons learned from Artemis I - generalization of our tools is crucial for avoiding software rewrites each mission. Ultimately, I was able to generalize the aborts automation framework to be mission-agnostic, such that I could simultaneously churn out thousands of trajectories for Artemis II, Artemis III, and future missions. This allowed me to properly answer questions from key stakeholders on what amount of abort capability we would have during various phases of the mission.",

These two tools historically had been developed completely separately from eachother and operated independently by different teams. Robust trajectory optimization, whereby a trajectory is optimized with uncertainty (from an imperfect GN&C system) accounted for in the system, is possible if the two tools could interface more directly.\nI was able to develop an interface that allowed Copernicus to optimize trajectories while receiving trajectory dispersion data from LinCov in a direct feedback loop. Additionally, I was able to develop additional avenues for injecting dispersion data into the optimization algorithm. For example, a LinCov “Emulator” was developed that could use multivariate polynomial regression to fit large datasets of offline LinCov runs; this allowed Copernicus to optimize trajectories in a fraction of the runtime. I published a conference paper on my recent progress towards this integration effort at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference in 2023.",

However, recent advances in GN&C systems and thermal protection systems make aerocapture more feasible now than it’s ever been in the past.

    "text": "First Author\n\nCopernicus/LinCov (CopCov) Software Integration in Support of Robust Trajectory Optimization\nCopernicus is a generalized spacecraft trajectory design and optimization software, commonly used to design reference trajectory profiles. LinCov is a completely separate tool, used to produce linear covariance analyses that determine how well an integrated GN&C system is able to fly the reference profile. While these two tools have historically been run independently, together they can achieve the notion of robust trajectory optimization, whereby a trajectory is optimized while accounting for system uncertanties. This paper highlights the implementation of the CopCov interface, which allows Copernicus and LinCov to jointly optimize trajectories through a direct feedback loop. This work was published and presented at the 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference in Big Sky, Montana.\n\n\nOptimal Angle of Attack Control for Aerocapture\nAerocapture is a maneuver in which a spacecraft redirects its trajectory by flying through a planet’s atmosphere to attain a desired orbit after atmospheric exit, typically at a fraction of the propellant cost of a fully propulsive maneuver. Direct Force Control (DFC) is a control methodology that varies the spacecraft’s angle of attack in order to target desired periapsis and apopasis altitudes of the post-atmospheric orbit. However, contrary to other control methodologies, there is no known optimal angle of attack profile for aerocapture trajectories using DFC. This paper uses principles of optimal control theory to numerically solve for the optimal angle of attack profile for an aerocpature mission at Mars. This work was published at the 2022 AIAA SciTech Forum in San Diego, California."

The Fully Numeric Predictor-corrector Aerocapture Guidance (FNPAG) algorithm, rooted in principles of optimal control theory, was chosen for this application. This paper details the implementation of the FNPAG algorithm in Julia programming language, various studies performed to tune its performance to Uranus-specific conditions, and delivery/integration of the algorithm into a C simulation framework.

I was fortunate enough to also get the chance to do plenty of On-the-Job-Training (OJTing), learning from flight controllers’ training during simulations and even real-time ISS operations. On the technical side, I also developed a ground display for use during flight of the Boeing CST Starliner vehicle.",

    "text": "Summer 2018 - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n\n\n\nThe Mars 2020 sky crane!\n\n\n\nI had always been interested in working at JPL, and was fortunate enough to receive an offer to join the Psyche team for a summer internship. Though I was joining a systems engineering team, they had actually been looking for a software engineering intern. Luckily, through my internship at Raytheon I had previous exposure to the software they were using - DOORS Next Generation (DNG) - as well as experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a personal love for software development.\nMy task was to develop a series of web “widgets” that would be integrated into the browser-based DNG software to support requirements development and verification/validation (V&V) planning. Though I am by no means an expert in web development, this task allowed me to be a self-starter and independently learn the software skills I needed to develop these applications. I also co-authored a paper on Early V&V planning for the Psyche mission as a part of my effort this summer.",

    "text": "Spring 2018 - NASA Johnson Space Center\nThis was my first internship working at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Positioned in the Integrated GN&C Branch, I was tasked with supporting Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) analyses for SpaceX’s Crew Dragon vehicle as a part of the Commercial Crew Program (CCP). I quickly delved into our C/C++ simulation framework in order to model the dynamics of the ascent abort cases I was analyzing. In addition to getting some great exposure to software development tools (i.e., Unix environments, Git, etc.) in a larger-scale project environment, I also learned practical applications of the control algorithms and dynamics models that I was learning in the classroom.",

I was a part of a team working on a modernized situational awareness avionics system for the HH-60G helicopter used by the U.S. Air National Guard. I performed a wide array of tasks in support of this effort, including requirements documentation using IBM’s DOORS software, a functional hazard analysis for the helmet mounted display system, and testing of the display system. Additionally, I also picked up an extra software development task, and learned HTML/CSS/JavaScript from scratch to enhance the functionality of a Six Sigma project that tracks integration and testing of manufactured assemblies.\n\n\n\nThis lander looks pretty neat!\nThe Neutral Buoyancy Lab at JSC\nThe Mars 2020 sky crane!\nJust a young engineer next to a tank",
