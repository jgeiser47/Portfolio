## About Me

Hi there, thanks for visiting my personal portfolio website! I am an aerospace engineer by trade, currently working in the Flight Mechanics and Trajectory Design Branch at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC). Before hiring on full-time, I completed eight internships between NASA JSC, NASA JPL, Blue Origin, and Raytheon. 

Although I come from an aerospace background, I am also passionate about software development. Through school, internships, and full-time work, I've been able to strengthen my programming skills and transition myself towards more software-oriented roles.

When not writing code to optimize trajectories for future Moon missions, I enjoy getting outdoors, climbing mountains, and training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
A unique fact about me is I have worked seasonally as a mountaineering guide on Mount Rainier!
