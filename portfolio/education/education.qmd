_The following is a summary of my formal education background._

## Stanford University

**Dates:** Sep 2020 - Mar 2022

**Degree:** Master's of Science

**Field:** Aeronautics & Astronautics

**GPA:** 4.00 / 4.00

I felt incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to attend Stanford University for my graduate degree. Within the realm of aerospace, I continued to further explore my specializations in astrodynamics and Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C). I performed graduate research under Professor Simone D'Amico, working on simulation development and analysis for a high-precision spacecraft formation flying mission known as VISORS. Though my degree was in the aero/astro department, I was also curious about many topics in computer science and autonomy, and took courses such as _Machine Learning_, _Decision Making Under Uncertainty_, _Principles of Robot Autonomy_, and _Programming Abstractions_. 

Outside of my own courses, I also was a teaching assistant at a variety of different levels. I spent one quarter TA'ing for a sales course within the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB). I would then TA for a graduate level classical controls course in the engineering department, one that I had excelled in when I took it myself a year prior. My last quarter at Stanford I TA'ed for an undergraduate level dynamics course within the engineering department. I found TA'ing to be an incredibly rewarding experience, realizing how much I enjoyed teaching and helping others learn complex technical material. Similar to undergrad, I also made time for fun - taking swim classes regularly, joining the jiu-jitsu club, participating in intramurals, and going on long trail runs around the peninsula.

## Purdue University

**Dates:** Aug 2015 - Dec 2019

**Degree:** Bachelor's of Science

**Field:** Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineering

**GPA:** 4.00 / 4.00

For my undergraduate education, I attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, about an hour away from my hometown. While here, I began to learn of my passion for aerospace and human spaceflight, and learned of Purdue's rich history in these fields. Towards the end of my degree, I began to specialize in the fields of dynamics and controls, with an emphasis on astrodynamics, and I realized that I wanted to attend graduate school to deepen my knowledge in these fields. I also got involved in undergraduate research with Professor Dengfeng Sun, developing a small Python simulation framework for simulating the dynamics and controls of aircraft in flight. 

I tried to be as involved as possible in an array of different extracurriculars while on campus. I was an active member of the Purdue Engineering Student Council (PESC) and held the position of Treasurer on PESC's Executive Committee. Additionally, I traveled to the United Nations in Austria as a part of a short-term study abroad program, was the Academics Chair and Scholarship Chair for my fraternity, and partook in Purdue's Co-Op program with NASA. I also made time for fun, joining the boxing and jiu-jitsu clubs, participating in various intramural sports, and running the annual Purdue half-marathon.
